# Custom Title Bar in Flet

A simple Flet application demonstrating how to create a custom title bar with window control buttons (minimize, maximize, close). This application shows how to implement a fully customized window experience using Flet's UI components.

## Features

- **Custom Title Bar**: Replace the default title bar with a custom one with an icon and title.
- **Window Controls**: Includes buttons to minimize, maximize/restore, and close the application window.
- **Dragable Title Bar**: The custom title bar can be dragged to move the window.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Flet 0.25.0

## How to run the application

Use the following commands:

1. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install flet
```

1. Run the application using the following command:

```bash
flet run
```

This will launch the application with a custom draggable title bar and window control buttons.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the title bar by modifying the `TitleBar` class in the source code.
